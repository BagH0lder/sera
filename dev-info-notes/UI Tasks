The UI is not functioning. Some issues are listed below.

Voice Readback Selector:
The selector is not functioning and should default to user preference (is a var in config)
Some voices did not work previousely and need to be fixed. Only Alloy and Sage worked.

Voice Recording (start button):
The voice recorder does not function.

Mode Selector:
The mode selector should be populated by the db
The current mode selected is sent in with the prompt 
If no mode detected/selected and on loading defaults to the last used mode

Send Button:
Send button does not work. 
Attach files seems to work (but not sure if it would send if it could.) 

Not Optional but Later/Next:
Persona section in the admin so the user can add personality to the session.
 - personas are multi-faceted such as a description and a name. Where the description may contain the gender of the assistant or maybe even virtual hair color or what ever the user desires.
Mode editor in admin.js. Siple add and edit/delete for each mode listed.
 - modes are multi faceted, like response tweaking and output format.
Section in admin for adding global rules (these will be injected into the payload)


Wish list:
Would like read outloud button under each response.
Need a mute button on the voice readback.
